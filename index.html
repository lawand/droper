	<h2>Usage Notes</h2>
		<p>There seem to be some issues when dealing with some files and folders which names contain symbols.</p>
		<p>The current version isn't optimized for minimal network traffic, use only with WLAN networks when using on a mobile device.</p>
	
	<h2>Notes For Developers</h2>
		<p>Droper is a C++/Qt4 application, and is tested with Qt 4.7.0 (on desktop platforms). Droper also requires OpenSSL (which is also <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7.old/requirements.html">required by Qt</a>)</p>
		<p>If you try to compile Droper, you'll notice that the <b>consumerdata.cpp</b> file is missing, it is a simple file that contains the values of the consumer key and secret. This file wasn't uploaded to the repository for security reasons. For more info search for and learn about OAuth.</p>
