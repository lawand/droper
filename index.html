	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Droper is a cross-platform application which helps Dropbox users access and modify their synced files and folders.</p>
		<p>This project is still in it's early development stages. It can access Dropbox accounts (it has been approved for production), but it is only intended for developers at this point.</p>

	<h2>Notes For Developers</h2>
		<p>Droper is a C++/Qt4 application, and is tested with Qt 4.7.0. Droper also requires OpenSSL (which is also <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7.old/requirements.html">required by Qt</a>)</p>
		<p>If you try to compile Droper, you'll notice that the <b>consumerdata.cpp</b> file is missing, it is a simple file that contains the values of the consumer key and secret. This file wasn't uploaded to the repository for security reasons. For more info search for and learn about OAuth.</p>
